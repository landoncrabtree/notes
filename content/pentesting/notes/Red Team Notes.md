# [KDE Plasma: Display VPN IP Address](https://store.kde.org/p/1166510/)

Display your tun0 IP address in a menu widget on Plasma. Useful for when connected to HackTheBox or TryHackMe so you can quickly reference your IP.

```bash
ADDR=$(ip addr | grep tun0|grep inet|awk '{print $2}'|cut -d "/" -f 1)
echo "$ADDR" | sed 's/$/ /g'
```

# [[Upgrading Reverse Shell to Interactive Shell]]

Upgrade basic reverse shells to interactive TTY shells for tab-completion, STDERR, history, and more.

# Data Exfil

```bash
# Download file from SSH to local machine
scp username@server:/file/to/send /where/to/put

# Download file from reverse shell to local machine
xxd -p <file>
perl -e 'local $/; print unpack "H*", <>' <file>
hexdump -e '2/1 "%02x"' -v <file>
python3 -c "import sys; data = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb').read(); print(''.join(f'{byte:02x}' for byte in data))" <file>
```

```python
with open("out.bin", "r") as file:
    data = file.read().strip()
with open("out", "wb") as file:
    file.write(bytes.fromhex(data))
```
