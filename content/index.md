# Welcome! 

This serves as a public repository of any notes I take. It serves the primary purposes of:
* Encouraging me to take well-documented and thorough notes
* Acting as a personal knowledge base for my learning 
* Acting as a public knowledge base for others interested in learning

# CTF Writeups
For assets related to CTF events, visit https://github.com/landoncrabtree/capture-the-flag
For scripts and tools to assist in CTFs, check out https://github.com/landoncrabtree/ctf-toolbox

I tried to do writeups for every challenge I solved, but that quickly began to be too burdensome. I now mostly writeup fun/unique solves.
